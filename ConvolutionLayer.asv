function c_n = ConvolutionLayer(x_n,D,L)
%this function is aim to calculate the value in the n th Convolution layer
%input: x_n is the value from the n th reconstuction layer
%D is a transform matrix for a filtering operation such as DWT,DCT.
%L is the number of z in column, which has been definited before.
for l = 1:L
    c_n(l) = D(l)*x_n;
end
%发现的小问题：可能直接通过矩阵乘法就可以实现了，但我先按照paper里的公式写。
%后面或许可以改进。
%Tips: This function is likely to be rewrite using matrix multiply
